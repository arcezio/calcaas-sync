# calcaas-sync

Push your **real** AI-tool token usage to your [Calcaas](https://calcaas.com) dashboard.

`calcaas-sync` is a tiny, privacy-preserving wrapper around
[**ccusage**](https://github.com/ccusage/ccusage). It runs ccusage locally, reads the
**numeric** daily token aggregates it produces, and uploads them to your Calcaas account so
you get a cloud dashboard of your usage **per tool, per model, per device, over time**.

> **Privacy:** only numeric aggregates leave your machine — date, model name, token counts,
> and ccusage's cost estimate. **No prompt or response content is ever read or transmitted.**

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (ccusage's floor).
- A coding-agent CLI that ccusage understands has been used on this machine —
  **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Gemini CLI**, **GitHub Copilot CLI**, **OpenCode**, and more.
  calcaas-sync auto-detects whichever ones you use and tags each row by tool.
- A **Calcaas device key** — generate one in the Calcaas app under **Usage Analytics →
  Connect a device** (it looks like `cal_live_…`). The key is shown once; copy it then.

`ccusage` is bundled as a dependency, so you install **one** thing and never touch ccusage
directly.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g github:arcezio/calcaas-sync
```

> Installs straight from GitHub using the prebuilt `dist/` — no build step, toolchain,
> or npm account needed. Once published to the npm registry, `npm install -g calcaas-sync`
> will also work.

## Usage

### 1. Log in (once per computer)

```bash
calcaas-sync login --key cal_live_xxxxxxxx --device "work-laptop"
```

Run with no flags to be prompted interactively. The device label is how this machine appears
in the dashboard's **By device** breakdown — give each computer a distinct one.

Config is written to `~/.calcaas/config.json` (mode `600`):

```json
{
  "apiKey": "cal_live_…",
  "endpoint": "https://…supabase.co/functions/v1/usage-ingest",
  "deviceLabel": "work-laptop",
  "intervalMinutes": 60
}
```

### 2. Sync

One-off push (great for cron):

```bash
calcaas-sync push                 # sync everything ccusage knows about
calcaas-sync push --since 2026-06-01
```

Keep it updated with a long-running watcher (default: hourly):

```bash
calcaas-sync watch                # push now, then every 60 min
calcaas-sync watch --interval 30
```

Re-syncing is **idempotent** — the server upserts on
`(tool, model, date, device)`, so running `push`/`watch` repeatedly never creates duplicates.

## Running `watch` as a background service

**Linux/macOS (pm2):**

```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start calcaas-sync --name calcaas -- watch
pm2 save && pm2 startup
```

**Linux/macOS (nohup):**

```bash
nohup calcaas-sync watch > ~/.calcaas/sync.log 2>&1 &
```

**macOS (launchd):** create `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.calcaas.sync.plist` with a
`ProgramArguments` of `[ "calcaas-sync", "watch" ]` and `RunAtLoad = true`, then
`launchctl load` it.

**Windows (Task Scheduler):** create a Basic Task, trigger **At log on**, action **Start a
program** → `calcaas-sync` with argument `watch`.

For cron-style setups, schedule `calcaas-sync push` instead (e.g. hourly) and skip `watch`.

## Multiple computers

Install and `login` on each machine with a **distinct `--device` label**. Every row is tagged
with its device, so the dashboard breaks usage down per machine.

## Configuration / flags

| Flag | Commands | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--key` | `login` | — | Your `cal_live_…` device key |
| `--device` | `login` | hostname | Label for this machine |
| `--endpoint` | `login` | Calcaas ingest URL | Override only for self-hosting |
| `--interval` | `login`, `watch` | `60` | Minutes between syncs in `watch` |
| `--since` | `push`, `watch` | — | `YYYY-MM-DD` lower bound |

## How it works

```
agent CLIs' local logs ──▶ ccusage <tool> daily --json ──▶ normalize ──▶ POST /usage-ingest ──▶ Calcaas
   (your machine)              (bundled, local)           (numeric only)   (Bearer cal_live_…)   (dashboard)
```

`calcaas-sync` runs the bundled ccusage to detect which agent CLIs have data, then pulls each
tool's `<tool> daily --json` separately, maps every `(tool × date × model)` entry to the
Calcaas wire contract, and POSTs batched aggregates with your key in the `Authorization` header.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev -- push      # run from source via tsx
npm test                 # vitest (normalizer unit tests)
npm run build            # tsc → dist/
```
